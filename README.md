# Floppy Disk Labels

A template for and examples of floppy disk labels made in Adobe Illustrator, including trim and bleed allowances for professional printing.

These labels were created to be used with a set of drinks coasters made from old floppy disks with a cork backing aplied to stop them slipping. The original paper labels soon broke down from damp and abrasion so these were printed in matte laminated vinyl.
